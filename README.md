# Hello 👋

I’m **Sourav Yadav**, a smart contract security researcher and competitive auditor, currently an engineering student at **IIIT Bhopal, India**.

I actively audit DeFi and protocol-layer smart contracts across leading competitive platforms, with a strong focus on **high-impact, systemic vulnerabilities**. My work primarily targets **protocol accounting invariants, share–asset conversions, rounding and precision errors, denial-of-service vectors, and state-dependent execution failures**.

I am particularly interested in issues that emerge only under realistic protocol evolution (interest accrual, virtual balances, sequencing assumptions), where subtle design flaws result in user-facing or protocol-level breakage.
